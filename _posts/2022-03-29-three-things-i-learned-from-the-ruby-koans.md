title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are some things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):

 - Ruby programmers tend to favor the shovel operator (<<) over the # plus equals operator (+=) when building up strings.
 - The shift() method removes the first item whereas the pop() method removes the last item in an array.
 - ArgumentError is raised when a method is called with an incorrect number of arguments.
 - If there is no explicit return in a method, it will return the bottom line.
 - Most everything in Ruby is true (except for false and nil)

These are some outstanding questions I had based on the Ruby Koans:

 - I'm not sure I understand the utility/functionality of a private method
 - Is there a more efficient way to do the triangle method than using and/or combinations?
