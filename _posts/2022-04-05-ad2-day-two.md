# Write about what you learned...

 - Moving forward we will be using xyz[0] or xyz.first rather than xyz.at(0), since at is not a function for active record
 - findby accomplishes the same thing as the where + at(0) combo we used in appdev 1
 - The find method does the same thing as findby, but can only be used on ID and it automatically raises an exception and returns a message
 - 404 and 500 error messages can be customized in the public folder
